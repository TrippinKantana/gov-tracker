# Government Asset Tracking & Security Platform

**Partnership: Lantern Cybersecurity & General Services Agency (GSA), Liberia**

A comprehensive asset management and tracking system for government resources including vehicles, facilities, IT devices, and equipment. Features real-time GPS tracking with Lantern SOS Tracker integration, role-based dashboards, and full-screen interactive maps.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
cd frontend && npm install
cd ../backend && npm install

# Set up environment
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# Edit backend/.env with your database and API keys

# Start development servers
npm run dev
```

Access the application:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:5000

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + PostGIS (geospatial)
- **Real-time**: Socket.IO for live GPS updates
- **Maps**: Mapbox GL JS with full-screen capability
- **Hardware**: Lantern SOS Tracker integration
