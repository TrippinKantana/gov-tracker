## ‚ö†Ô∏è Slide 10: Considerations & Transparency

### Honest Assessment

**Requirements for Success:**

**1. Internet Connectivity**
- Stable internet connection required
- Backup internet recommended for critical sites
- Mobile data for field operations
- **Mitigation**: System caches data for offline viewing

**2. User Adoption**
- Staff training essential
- Change management needed
- Initial resistance expected
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive training program included

**3. Data Migration**
- Existing paper records need digitization
- Initial data entry time investment
- Quality control during migration
- **Mitigation**: Templates and bulk import tools provided

**4. GPS Coverage**
- GPS signals may be weak in some remote areas
- Cellular network needed for real-time tracking
- **Mitigation**: GPS devices store data when offline, sync when signal returns

**5. Ongoing Costs**
- Annual license fee for updates (Year 2+)
- Internet/hosting costs
- GPS device replacement (if damaged)
- **Mitigation**: Predictable, budgetable costs

**What This System Does NOT Do:**
- ‚ùå Does not replace financial accounting systems
- ‚ùå Does not process payroll
- ‚ùå Does not replace procurement workflows (but integrates with them)
- ‚ùå Does not guarantee user compliance (requires policy enforcement)

## üé§ APPENDIX E: Objection Handling

### Common Concerns & Responses

**"This is too expensive"**
‚Üí "Compared to international solutions at $500K-$2M, this is 80-90% cheaper. The ROI is achieved in 15 days. We'll lose more than $100K in the next month without this system."

**"We need to see it work first"**
‚Üí "We're offering a live demonstration right now. We can also provide a 30-day pilot program with one MAC for $35K, fully credited toward full purchase."

**"What if we have problems and you're not available?"**
‚Üí "We're local - based in Monrovia. We'll be on-site within an hour for emergencies. Compare that to waiting weeks for international vendors. Plus, you own the source code."

**"Our internet is not reliable"**
‚Üí "The system works offline for viewing cached data. GPS devices store data and sync when signal returns. We also offer on-premise deployment if needed, though cloud is more reliable than local internet."

**"We don't have technical staff"**
‚Üí "We provide complete training - 6 days for up to 50 people. The interface is designed for non-technical users. Our support team handles all technical issues."

**"Can we pay in installments?"**
‚Üí "Yes, we offer flexible payment terms: 40% signing, 30% at training completion, 30% at go-live. Or monthly payment plan over 12 months with small interest."

**"What if the system doesn't work?"**
